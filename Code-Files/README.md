## Files

### Game files

- BaconGame.java: Implements the core functionality of the Kevin Bacon Game, including graph construction from datasets, handling user commands, and performing graph-based analyses such as shortest path queries, average separation calculations, and degree analysis using BFS and adjacency map representations.

- GraphLibrary.java: Provides graph analysis utilities, including BFS for constructing shortest-path trees, methods to compute average separation, identify disconnected vertices, and reconstruct paths from a vertex to the root. Utilizes recursion for depth-based computations and allows flexibility with generic vertex and edge types.

### Data files

- actors.txt: Gives a number to each actor in a list of actors

- movie-actors.txt: Pairs movies to actors using their numerical representations from `actors.txt` and `movies.txt`

- movies.txt: Gives a number to each movie in a list of movies
